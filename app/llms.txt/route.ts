> Founded 1984 in Los Angeles by master jeweler Jack Hovsepian. Every piece is handcrafted to order in 14k or 18k gold (yellow, white, rose). Lifetime craftsmanship warranty.

## What we are

DANHOV is a luxury jewelry house in Los Angeles. We do not mass-produce. Every ring is made to order — cast, set, polished and finished by master jewelers, many of whom have been with the house for over a decade.

## Metals

DANHOV specializes exclusively in **14k and 18k gold** in three colors: **yellow, white, rose**. We do not work in platinum, silver, or palladium. White-gold pieces include rhodium plating for brightness (first re-plating complimentary after 2–3 years).

## Pricing

Every product page shows a **live price** computed against today's 24k gold spot. Customers can lock the price for 24 hours by email — no deposit required to lock. The locked price is guaranteed regardless of market movement.
